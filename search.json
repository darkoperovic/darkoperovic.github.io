Experimentally characterized smoke produced by fires in most common insulating oils and cable types present at CERN. Used Cone Calorimeter (FTT) coupled with DMS500 fast particulate analyser (CAMBUSTION Ltd). Conducted a literature review and proposed a methodology for addressing vehicle fires at CERN (more than 300 different vehicle types used).","tags":[],"title":"Master thesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Darko Perović, Ivan Glišović, Boško Stefanović"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451142366,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451142366,"objectID":"8d39f394fd73fd0041a8979bdaa2b87a","permalink":"https://darkoperovic.com/publication/bachelor_thesis/","publishdate":"2015-12-26T17:06:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bachelor_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Detailed analysis, calculations and drawings for the whole project from scratch.","tags":[],"title":"Bachelor thesis","type":"publication"}]
